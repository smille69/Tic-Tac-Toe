Instructions for TicTacToe:

Summary:
This project is a sample project I created using Django, Django Rest Framework, Durandal, Knockout, and Bootstrap.
I did this as a proof of concept for me since I have been working with Durandal, Knockout, and Bootstrap in an MVC 
environment in the Windows world.  This is a fully working Single Page Application with Django Rest backend.  Its
by no means complete and does have some errors. I just tried to get it out to you without taking too much time on it.


1) Create a virtualenv (if needed) for project
2) Unzip project into a seperate directory
3) Install required modules for Django project (see requirements.txt in requirements directory)
	- Django 1.6.2
	- DjangoRestFramework, etc..
4) Create a database, but its really not needed.  You remove the db settings in the setting.py if needed.
	- Create database named db_ddtest
	- Add user to mysql database named ddtest with password of ddtest. See settings.py.
5) Run the project as a standard django project: python manage.py runserver from command line.

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.
